Botoholt was created in order to shazam tracks and write their names in the chat. And if you use DonationAlerts as a platform for donations and ordering music, then the audience, thanks to this tool, will be able to find out the exact name of the next remix gachi, their place in the order queue, the time before their song, view the entire queue, compete for a place in the top DJs And so on!
